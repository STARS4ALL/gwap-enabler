The gwap enabler is a framework[1] that allows to design and develop GWAP web applications to solve data linking issue. The linking problems that can be addressed using the enabler are _Link creation_, _Link validation_ and _Link ranking_.

Each GWAP is a simple casual game organized in rounds; each round is formed by several levels and each level requires the player to perform a single action, which corresponds to the creation, ranking or validation of a link. 
The GWAP is an output-agreement double-player game: users play in random pairs and the game score is based on the agreement between the answers provided by the player.
The game adopts a repeated linking approach by asking different players to address the same data linking task; conversely, the same task is never given twice to the same player. The “true” solution of a data linking task, therefore, comes from the aggregation of the answers provided by all the users who “played” the task in any game round.
To engage users a set of gamification tools has been embedded in the framework, such as points, leaderboards and badges. 

The gwap-enabler has been developed under the EU H2020 project STARS4ALL[2].
